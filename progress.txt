[2026-02-05] #1 feat: Create TypeScript TUI app for macOS container management
- Files: package.json, tsconfig.json, eslint.config.js, jest.config.js, .prettierrc, src/types/index.ts, src/services/container-cli.ts, src/services/health-check.ts, src/hooks/useContainerData.ts, src/hooks/useKeyboard.ts, src/components/*.tsx, src/index.tsx, src/__tests__/*.ts
- Changes: Complete TUI application using Ink (React for CLI) with container/image/network/volume management, vim-style navigation, search/filter, real-time refresh, help overlay
- Decisions: Used Ink v5 for React-based TUI, wrapped macOS `container` CLI commands, used inverse text for selection highlighting
- Issues: None - all acceptance criteria met
