[2026-02-05] #1 feat: Create TypeScript TUI app for macOS container management
- Files: package.json, tsconfig.json, eslint.config.js, jest.config.js, .prettierrc, src/types/index.ts, src/services/container-cli.ts, src/services/health-check.ts, src/hooks/useContainerData.ts, src/hooks/useKeyboard.ts, src/components/*.tsx, src/index.tsx, src/__tests__/*.ts
- Changes: Complete TUI application using Ink (React for CLI) with container/image/network/volume management, vim-style navigation, search/filter, real-time refresh, help overlay
- Decisions: Used Ink v5 for React-based TUI, wrapped macOS `container` CLI commands, used inverse text for selection highlighting
- Issues: None - all acceptance criteria met

[2026-02-05] #3 chore: Set up semantic releases and project documentation
- Files: package.json, .releaserc.json, commitlint.config.js, .husky/commit-msg, .github/workflows/release.yml, .github/workflows/ci.yml, README.md, AGENT.md, progress.txt
- Changes: Configured semantic-release with changelog/npm/git plugins, added commitlint with conventional commits, set up husky commit-msg hook, created CI/release workflows, wrote comprehensive README and AGENT.md
- Decisions: Used pnpm-compatible husky v9, semantic-release v24 with standard plugins, commitlint strict mode for subject-case
- Issues: None

[2026-02-05] #5 chore: Configure semantic-release commit message line length limits
- Files: commitlint.config.js
- Changes: Disabled body-max-line-length and footer-max-line-length rules to allow semantic-release notes and Co-Authored-By footers
- Decisions: Set rules to severity 0 (disabled) rather than increasing limit to avoid arbitrary caps
- Issues: None

[2026-02-05] #7 chore: Configure npm publishing to use @rotorsoft namespace
- Files: package.json, README.md
- Changes: Updated package name to @rotorsoft/contui, added publishConfig.access=public for scoped public publishing, added npm version badge to README
- Decisions: Scoped packages require explicit public access; semantic-release npm plugin handles scoped packages without config changes
- Issues: None - CI npm token must have @rotorsoft scope permissions

[2026-02-05] #9 fix: Add npm-only dist packaging and release update UX
- Files: package.json, jest.config.js, README.md, src/components/App.tsx, src/components/StatusBar.tsx, src/hooks/useReleaseCheck.ts, src/utils/app-version.ts, src/types/ink-testing-library.d.ts, src/__tests__/release-check.test.ts, src/__tests__/status-bar.test.tsx
- Changes: Restricted npm package contents to dist, added version display and async release check in the UI, and documented npm install/run steps with supporting tests.
- Decisions: Pulled current version from env/package.json and used npm registry latest endpoint for update checks.
- Issues: Release workflow may still need updates to publish; requires approval to modify .github/workflows.

[2026-02-11] #12 feat: Add container creation with image selection, port mapping, and naming
- Files: src/types/index.ts, src/services/container-cli.ts, src/components/RunContainerDialog.tsx, src/components/App.tsx, src/hooks/useKeyboard.ts, src/components/HelpOverlay.tsx, src/__tests__/container-cli.test.ts, README.md
- Changes: Added `runContainer` CLI method with `buildRunArgs` helper, multi-field RunContainerDialog (image, name, ports, env), `n` shortcut on Containers/Images tabs with image pre-fill from Images tab
- Decisions: Exported `buildRunArgs` as standalone function for testability; used Tab key to cycle between fields in dialog; comma-separated ports/env input
- Issues: None
