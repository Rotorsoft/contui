[2026-02-05] #1 feat: Create TypeScript TUI app for macOS container management
- Files: package.json, tsconfig.json, eslint.config.js, jest.config.js, .prettierrc, src/types/index.ts, src/services/container-cli.ts, src/services/health-check.ts, src/hooks/useContainerData.ts, src/hooks/useKeyboard.ts, src/components/*.tsx, src/index.tsx, src/__tests__/*.ts
- Changes: Complete TUI application using Ink (React for CLI) with container/image/network/volume management, vim-style navigation, search/filter, real-time refresh, help overlay
- Decisions: Used Ink v5 for React-based TUI, wrapped macOS `container` CLI commands, used inverse text for selection highlighting
- Issues: None - all acceptance criteria met

[2026-02-05] #3 chore: Set up semantic releases and project documentation
- Files: package.json, .releaserc.json, commitlint.config.js, .husky/commit-msg, .github/workflows/release.yml, .github/workflows/ci.yml, README.md, AGENT.md, progress.txt
- Changes: Configured semantic-release with changelog/npm/git plugins, added commitlint with conventional commits, set up husky commit-msg hook, created CI/release workflows, wrote comprehensive README and AGENT.md
- Decisions: Used pnpm-compatible husky v9, semantic-release v24 with standard plugins, commitlint strict mode for subject-case
- Issues: None

[2026-02-05] #5 chore: Configure semantic-release commit message line length limits
- Files: commitlint.config.js
- Changes: Disabled body-max-line-length and footer-max-line-length rules to allow semantic-release notes and Co-Authored-By footers
- Decisions: Set rules to severity 0 (disabled) rather than increasing limit to avoid arbitrary caps
- Issues: None
